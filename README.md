# Database zooplankton traits

This repository provides a comprehensive database of zooplankton physiological and ecological traits. Each sheet within the Excel file represents a specific physiological or ecological rate, including:

Clearance Rate (L.d-1)
Respiration Rate (mmol.d-1)
Growth Rate (d-1)
Predator-Prey Size Ratio (µm.µm-1)
Feeding Mode: The mode by which zooplankton obtain food (e.g., feeding current feeders, active and passive ambush feeders, cruise feeders).
Assimilation Rate (%C) 

As indicated in the paper associated with this data base (Lemoine et al., in prep), for temperature-sensitive rates, values have been standardized to a reference temperature of 15°C. Additionally, depending on the mass measured experimentally (whether carbon mass or wet mass), the missing mass has been determined based on individual carbon content. The carbon percentages follow the reference values as defined by McConville et al., 2016. 

This database aims to provide a reliable foundation for ecological modeling, comparative analyses, and physiological studies of zooplankton. We hope it will support further research in aquatic ecosystems and zooplankton ecology. If you have any questions or comments, please send a mail at julie.lemoine@imev-mer.fr

# Reproducibility of Figures and Statistical Analyses
This repository includes R script used to create Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the associated article. The script provide a step-by-step workflow for generating the figures and conducting the statistical tests, enabling users to replicate the exact analyses used in the article.
